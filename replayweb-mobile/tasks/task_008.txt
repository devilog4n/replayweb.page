# Task ID: 8
# Title: Performance Optimization and Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize app performance, handle edge cases, and implement comprehensive testing for various scenarios.
# Details:
1. Implement memory management for large archives:
```swift
// Monitor memory warnings
func applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning(_ application: UIApplication) {
  // Clear non-essential caches
  URLCache.shared.removeAllCachedResponses()
  
  // Notify web app about memory pressure
  webView.evaluateJavaScript("if (window.notifyLowMemory) window.notifyLowMemory();")
}
```
2. Optimize HTTP server for range requests with large files
3. Add logging and analytics for performance monitoring
4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
5. Add unit and UI tests for critical functionality
6. Test with various archive sizes and types
7. Optimize startup time and resource usage

# Test Strategy:
1. Perform load testing with large WACZ archives (>1GB)
2. Test on various iOS devices (older and newer models)
3. Monitor memory usage during extended usage sessions
4. Verify performance with multiple archives loaded sequentially
5. Test range request performance with large files
6. Validate app behavior under memory pressure
7. Run automated UI tests for critical user flows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Advanced Memory Management for Large Archives [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance memory management strategies to efficiently handle large archive files, including proactive cache clearing and memory warning handling.
### Details:
Utilize tools like the Memory Graph Debugger and implement ARC best practices to prevent memory leaks and excessive usage. Integrate logic to clear non-essential caches and notify the web app during memory pressure events.

## 2. Optimize HTTP Server for Efficient Range Requests [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Improve the HTTP server's handling of range requests, especially for large files, to ensure smooth streaming and partial downloads.
### Details:
Implement efficient file reading and buffering strategies to support range requests without loading entire files into memory. Profile and optimize server response times for large file access.

## 3. Integrate Logging and Analytics for Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Add comprehensive logging and analytics to monitor app performance, resource usage, and user interactions.
### Details:
Instrument key code paths with logging for memory usage, server response times, and error events. Integrate analytics tools to track performance metrics and user behavior.

## 4. Implement Robust Error Handling and User Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop error handling mechanisms and user feedback systems to gracefully manage failures and inform users of issues.
### Details:
Design user-friendly error messages and fallback behaviors for scenarios such as failed downloads, memory pressure, or server errors. Ensure all critical errors are logged and reported.

## 5. Develop and Execute Comprehensive Unit and UI Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Create and run unit and UI tests covering critical functionality, edge cases, and performance scenarios.
### Details:
Write automated tests for memory management, HTTP server range requests, error handling, and startup performance. Include tests for different archive sizes and types.
