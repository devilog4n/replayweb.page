# Task ID: 4
# Title: Configure WKWebView with Service Worker Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up WKWebView to load content from the local HTTP server with proper configuration for Service Worker support.
# Details:
1. Create and configure WKWebView:
```swift
func setupWebView() {
  let config = WKWebViewConfiguration()
  config.limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains = true
  config.websiteDataStore = .default()
  
  webView = WKWebView(frame: view.bounds, configuration: config)
  webView.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]
  view.addSubview(webView)
  
  // Load initial page
  if let url = URL(string: "http://localhost:8080/index.html") {
    webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
  }
}
```
2. Add WKNavigationDelegate to handle navigation events
3. Implement JavaScript message handlers if needed for communication
4. Add error handling for page load failures
5. Ensure proper cleanup of WebKit data store when needed

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify WKWebView loads the index.html from local server
2. Use Safari Web Inspector to confirm Service Worker is registered
3. Check console logs for any errors during page load
4. Test that limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains is working correctly
5. Validate that the WebView renders correctly on different device sizes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure App-Bound Domains in Info.plist [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the WKAppBoundDomains key to Info.plist to enable Service Worker support for specific domains including localhost.
### Details:
Add the WKAppBoundDomains array to Info.plist with entries for trusted domains (up to 10) including 'localhost'. This is required since iOS 14 to enable Service Worker functionality in WKWebView. Ensure limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains is set to true in the WKWebViewConfiguration.

## 2. Implement Custom WKURLSchemeHandler [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a custom URL scheme handler to properly intercept and handle Service Worker requests.
### Details:
Implement a WKURLSchemeHandler subclass that can properly handle Service Worker registration and activation requests. Register this handler with the WKWebViewConfiguration using setURLSchemeHandler(_:forURLScheme:) method before initializing the WKWebView.

## 3. Modify WebKit Data Store Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Configure the WebKit data store to properly persist Service Worker data between app sessions.
### Details:
Use a non-ephemeral WKWebsiteDataStore to ensure Service Worker data persists. Configure the data store with appropriate cache policies and storage quotas. Add code to handle data store cleanup when needed while preserving Service Worker registrations.

## 4. Implement Service Worker Debugging Support [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Add debugging capabilities to monitor Service Worker lifecycle and troubleshoot issues.
### Details:
Enable remote debugging by adding NSAllowsLocalNetworking and NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent to App Transport Security settings. Implement JavaScript interfaces to monitor Service Worker registration, activation, and error events. Add logging for Service Worker lifecycle events.

## 5. Handle Service Worker Fallback Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Implement fallback strategies for environments where Service Workers are not supported.
### Details:
Add detection code to check if Service Workers are available in the current WKWebView environment. Implement alternative caching and offline functionality using IndexedDB, LocalStorage, or Cookies when Service Workers are unavailable. Create a JavaScript bridge to communicate Service Worker support status to the web content.
