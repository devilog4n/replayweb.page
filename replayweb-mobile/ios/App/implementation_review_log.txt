## 3. Implementation Issues & Fixes

### 3.1 Critical Issues

#### 3.1.0 Improper JavaScript Integration
- ❌ MainViewController was using direct URL navigation instead of JavaScript `setArchiveURL` method
- **Fix Applied**: Updated `loadArchive` method in MainViewController.swift to:
  - Use JavaScript `window.setArchiveURL()` method as specified in PRD section 3.3
  - Implement proper error handling with fallback to direct navigation
  - Provide detailed logging for both successful and failed attempts
  - Add support for both initial loading and subsequent archive changes

#### 3.1.1 Module Import Errors
- ❌ Multiple "No such module 'UIKit'" errors across source files
- **Fix Applied**: Created and executed `fix_module_errors_v2.sh` script which:
  - Creates a custom module map file for UIKit, WebKit, and Foundation
  - Updates the CocoaPods xcconfig files with proper module search paths
  - Adds a UIKitBridge.swift file that exports the frameworks globally
  - Updates the bridging header
  - Clears Xcode caches
- **Required Steps**:
  1. Close Xcode completely
  2. Reopen the App.xcworkspace (not xcodeproj)
  3. Clean the build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
  4. Build the project (Cmd+B)

#### 3.1.2 URL Scheme Mismatch
- ❌ capacitor.config.json was using `capacitor://localhost` instead of required `http://localhost:8080`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated capacitor.config.json to use correct scheme

#### 3.1.3 Code Redundancy in WKWebView Configuration
- ✅ No redundancy found in current implementation with `limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains` setting
- **Fix Status**: Upon detailed review of MainViewController.swift, only one instance of `limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains` setting was found (line 403)
- The previous log mentioned redundancy at lines 262 and 269, but these line numbers seem to be outdated or the issue has been resolved in a previous update
- Current code properly sets this critical property once within the iOS 14+ availability check

### 3.2 Improvement Opportunities

#### 3.2.1 WACZ Validation
- ✅ **Improvement Applied**: Enhanced WACZ validation with structure verification
- The ArchiveManager now uses `unzip -l` to inspect WACZ file contents
- Verifies the presence of required files:
  - `archive.cdx` (CDX index)
  - `datapackage.json` (Metadata)
  - `pages/pages.jsonl` (Pages index)
  - Checks for the presence of a warc files directory
- Implements a graceful fallback if `unzip` command is unavailable
- Requires at least 2 of the 3 key files to be present for validation to pass
- Provides detailed logging of missing components

#### 3.2.2 Service Worker Caching Strategies
- ✅ **Improvement Applied**: Enhanced Service Worker with advanced caching strategies
- Implemented specialized caching for different content types:
  - Cache-first strategy for static assets
  - Network-first strategy for HTML navigation
  - Specialized handling for WACZ/WARC files
  - Optimized range request handling for archive files
- Added intelligent cache management:
  - Time-based expiration (7 days for static content, 30 days for WACZ content)
  - Maximum entry limits for each cache type
  - Storage quota monitoring and adaptive caching based on available space
  - Cache cleanup during activation to prevent stale content
- Implemented more robust error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Added detailed logging for debugging cache operations
- Optimized streaming performance for large archive files
- Added timestamp tracking for all cached entries

#### 3.2.3 Directory Path Validation
- ✅ **Improvement Applied**: Added comprehensive directory validation
- WebServerManager now performs thorough validation of directory paths:
  - Validates that the `www` directory contains required files (index.html, sw.js)
  - Checks that `index.html` contains Service Worker registration code
  - Verifies that directories are writable using test file creation/deletion
  - Checks available disk space and warns if low (<100 MB)
  - Validates both bundle paths and project paths
  - Provides clear error messages for specific validation failures
  - Implements graceful fallbacks for non-critical issues

#### 3.2.4 Module Import Issues
- ✅ **Implemented**: Comprehensive fix for "No such module 'UIKit'" errors
- Resolved CocoaPods integration issues:
  - Fixed UTF-8 encoding requirements by setting LANG=en_US.UTF-8
  - Successfully reinstalled all pod dependencies with updated configuration
  - Verified correct import statements in Swift files
- Implemented strategic fixes to resolve framework import issues:
  - Updated module search paths in project build settings to include SDK frameworks
  - Created a dedicated UIKit.modulemap file to explicitly map UIKit framework
  - Added ModuleImporter.swift to provide @_exported imports of system frameworks
  - Simplified bridging header to eliminate path resolution conflicts
  - Updated Podfile post-install hook with critical framework linking settings
  - Added specific SDK search paths (including iPhoneSimulator18.2.sdk)
  - Cleaned derived data and rebuild project with corrected settings
  - Added proper module declarations and framework references
- Ensured UIKit and other system frameworks are properly linked:
  - Added explicit linker flags for UIKit, Foundation, and WebKit
  - Fixed framework search paths in multiple build configurations
  - Resolved Xcode module caching issues through complete rebuild

#### 3.1.4 Missing Offline Page Implementation
- ❌ Several calls to `showOfflinePage()` method, but the method itself was not implemented
- **Fix Applied**: Implemented `showOfflinePage()` and `loadGenericOfflinePage()` methods in MainViewController.swift to:
  - Try to use Service Worker for offline navigation if registered
  - Attempt to load page from fallback cache if Service Worker unavailable
  - Display a user-friendly offline page with retry button if both mechanisms fail
  - Show information about the active archive even when offline
  - Provide clear instructions to users about connectivity status

## 4. Verification Checklist

After implementing the fixes, verify:

1. **Module Import Resolution**: No more "No such module 'UIKit'" errors when building
2. **Service Worker Registration**: Service Worker registers successfully (use diagnostic tools)
3. **WACZ File Import**: Importing and viewing WACZ archives works correctly
4. **Offline Functionality**: App works correctly without network access after initial content loading
5. **Range Requests**: Large WACZ files stream properly without memory issues
6. **Offline Page Behavior**: Verify the offline page appears when network is lost and shows proper archive information
