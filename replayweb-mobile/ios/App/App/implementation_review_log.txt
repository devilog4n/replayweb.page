# Implementation Review Log for UIKit Module Import Issues

## Issue Description
Persistent "No such module 'UIKit'" errors occurring across multiple Swift files in the iOS project.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, the issue appears to be related to:
1. Module search path conflicts between the app target and CocoaPods
2. Incorrect framework search paths in the project configuration
3. Module map configuration issues

## Solutions Attempted

### 1. Podfile Modifications
- Updated post-install hooks to properly configure framework search paths
- Removed problematic settings that conflicted with CocoaPods configuration
- Simplified build settings to prevent conflicts

### 2. Module Map Configuration
- Created a module.modulemap file to explicitly map UIKit and other system frameworks
- Updated module map to use umbrella headers and relative paths for better compatibility
- Added proper linking directives to ensure UIKit is properly linked

### 3. Xcconfig File Updates
- Enhanced Config.xcconfig with more robust framework search paths
- Added comprehensive compiler settings for proper module imports
- Ensured proper Swift and Objective-C interoperability settings

### 4. Import Helper Files
- Created UIKitImport.swift as a central import point
- Used conditional imports to handle platform-specific frameworks
- Added reference symbols to force proper linking

### 5. Bridging Header Simplification
- Simplified the bridging header to avoid conflicts
- Properly structured header guards
- Removed unnecessary imports that could cause conflicts

## Next Steps
To resolve the remaining UIKit module import issues:

1. Clean the project completely:
   - Use Xcode's "Clean Build Folder" option (Shift+Cmd+K)
   - Delete the DerivedData folder
   - Reinstall pods with `pod deintegrate && pod install`

2. Update Xcode project settings:
   - Make sure "Module" option is enabled in Build Settings
   - Set "Always Search User Paths" to NO
   - Verify Framework Search Paths includes system frameworks
   - Check that "Import Paths" includes the module directory

3. If issues persist:
   - Consider creating a new Xcode project and migrating code
   - Check for compatibility issues between Xcode version and iOS SDK
   - Verify that all CocoaPods are compatible with the current Xcode version

## Conclusion
The "No such module 'UIKit'" error is particularly challenging in iOS projects using CocoaPods because it involves the complex interplay between the Swift module system, Xcode's build process, and CocoaPods' integration. The solutions implemented should provide a robust fix, but may require additional environment-specific adjustments.
